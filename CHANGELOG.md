- Designated as **Experimental**. Not for production use.
- Performance tuning for containerized environments.

### Features
- **Adaptive Wait Strategy**: Unified Hybrid Spin (Spin -> Yield -> Sleep) for Host and Guest.
- **Zero-Copy Slot API**: Generic `Send` with negative size support for end-alignment (replacing `SendFlatBuffer`).
- **Safety**: Added robust checks for `Init` failures (e.g., file descriptor limits).

- **Removed Queues**: SPSC/MPSC implementations removed. Only **Direct Mode** is supported.
- **Header-Only C++**: Library moved entirely to `include/shm/`. `src/` directory removed.

### Features
- **Guest Call**: Allows Go Guest to initiate calls to C++ Host (Async/Callback pattern).
- **Guest Slots**: Dedicated slot range for Guest-to-Host calls.
- **Zero-Copy Support**: `ZeroCopySlot` (C++) and `GuestSlot` (Go) for direct shared memory access.
